# py-adhore

Utilities for doing and visualizing synteny/co-linearity analyses using
I-ADHoRe.  This is meant to replace the tools provided by `wgd syn` in the
[wgd]( https://github.com/arzwa/wgd/) package. It is mainly a wrapper to enable
easier usage of I-ADHoRe and to provide the associated visualizations one
usually desires.

To install, clone the repository, `cd` into it and type `pip install .`. Works
with python3.
